"""Regression tests for the PEP 561 ``py.typed`` marker.

``pacs008_mcp`` is ``mypy --strict`` clean, but without the ``py.typed``
marker shipped in the distribution, downstream consumers get none of those
annotations. If the marker is ever dropped from the source tree or the
packaging ``include`` list, these tests fail before a release goes out.
